/** OPERATORS: 
 * 
 * In javascript operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic 
 * operations and more. Below is a list of different types of operators.
 */


// Assignment Operators //
= += -= *= /= %=
// An assignment operator is used t assigna value to a variable. It allows you to store values in 
// variables, and can be used in combination with other operators to modify the value of a variable 
// in a more consise way.

let x = 10;  // Assigns 10 to variable x


// Arithmetic Operators //
+ - * / % ++= -- **
// Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric values or variables.
// These opertors allow you to carry out basic calculations such as addition, subtraction, mulitpilication,
// division, and more.

let a = 4;
let b = 2;
let sum = a + b;  // sum becomes 6

let a = 4;
let b = 2;
let difference = a - b;  // difference becomes 2

let a = 4;
let b = 2;
let product = a * b;  // product becomes 8


// Comparison Operators //
== === != !== < <= > >=
// Comparison operators are used to compare to values or expressions. These operators return a boolean
// value: either true or false, depending on whether the comparison is valid. 

5 == 5;    // true (both are numbers and equal)
'5' == 5;  // true (string '5' is converted to number 5)

5 === 5;    // true (same value and type)
'5' === 5;  // false (different types: string vs number)

5 != 6;     // true (values are not equal)
'5' != 5;   // false (both are equal after type coercion)


// Logical Operators //

// Unary Operators //

// Ternary Operator //
