/** CONTROL FLOW
 * Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
 * Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, Unless the computer
 * runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such
 * as conditionals and loops. 
 * 
 * Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish
 * but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.
